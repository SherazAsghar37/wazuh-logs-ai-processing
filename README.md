<p id="description">A Wazuh AI‑driven log processing system that intercepts and analyzes Wazuh agent logs and incoming data packets in real time. It uses multiple custom‑trained machine learning models (LSTM and Random Forest) to detect anomalies and suspicious activity and feeds actionable results back into the Wazuh Dashboard for visibility. The backend is built with FastAPI for efficient log ingestion and processing and the system integrates Suricata Snort and Sysmon to enhance network and endpoint activity monitoring.</p>
